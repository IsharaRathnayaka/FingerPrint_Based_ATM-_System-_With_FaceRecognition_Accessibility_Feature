A feasibility study is essential to evaluate costs and benefits
Proposed system.
	Technical feasibility
	Economic feasibility 
	Operational feasibility
	Schedule feasibility
                  	Technical Feasibility
Much of resource determination is related to technical feasibility assessment. It considers the technical requirements of the proposed project. 
In Technical Feasibility study, one must test whether the proposed system can be developed using existing technology or not.
It is planned to implement the proposed system using C# technology. It is evident that the necessary hardware and software are available for development and implementation of the proposed system.
Hence, the solution is technically feasible. This project is a complete web-based application. the key technologies and tools that are combined with the system are,
